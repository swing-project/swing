    <div class="tab content1">
        <p>Welcome to the <span class="accent">humanOS</span> docs!</p>
        <p>It's currently a bit rough due to the current absence of many controls, please excuse that.</p>
        <p>Use the tabs above to switch sections.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tab content2">
        <h2>Desktop</h2>
        <p>This section contains information about the desktop and features on it.</p>
    
        <h3>System Menu</h3>
        <p>At the top of the screen is the system menu. It contains information, which when clicked on show dropdowns.</p>
        <p>Here is some information about each of these.</p>

        <h4>Applications</h4>
        <p>When clicked on, this will bring down a dropdown with a (currently non-functional) search menu and a grid of available
            applications on the system with their icon.</p>
        <p>The default behaviour can be changed to the previous applications list, where it opens a new application with
            a list of all of the system applications. However, this menu currently <i>only</i> does system applications,
            so it may not be useful until future updates.</p>

        <h4>Date & Time</h4>
        <p>This shows the date & time.</p>
        <p>Clicking on it currently does nothing, but it is planned to pull down a basic calendar which allows
            to write events directly in the dropdown.</p>
        <p>Due to this possible future behaviour, humanOS may not ever have a calendar app.</p>

        <h4>System Controls</h4>
        <p>The GUI was modelled off of Cosmic, so this is here even though it won't really have a use.</p>
        <p>Huh.</p>
        <p>That's a bit of a problem.</p>

        <h3>Dock</h3>
        <p>The bottom of the screen has the dock. It contains icons representing all of your open tasks. If there are no
            tasks, the dock will slide down.</p>
        <p>Clicking on an icon in the dock will set focus to the corresponding window.
            Double-clicking will close it.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tab content3">
        <h2>Windows</h2>
        <p>This section contains information about the window system humanOS uses.</p>
    
        <h3>Title bar</h3>
        <p>The title bar shows the title given to the window and a close button on the right.</p>
        <p>Clicking on the close button closes the window.</p>
        <p>Double-clicking on the title bar folds the window. This is the main way to hide windows currently since there is no
            minimize feature yet.</p>

        <h3>Menubar</h3>
        <p>The menubar is a way to interact with the app, and it contains a bunch of dropdowns with options.</p>
    
        <h3>Options bar</h3>
        <p>Some applications, such as Run, contain a bar of buttons at the bottom that do actions related to the task.</p>
        <p>These buttons will have text labels which will explain the purpose of the button.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tab content4">
        <h2>Productivity Features</h2>
        <p>This section contains information about the productivity features in humanOS.</p>
    
        <h3>Shorcuts</h3>
        <p>humanOS is designed with productivity and effeciency in mind. It has plenty of shortcuts to keep this paradigm in
            mind.</p>
        <p>Try a shortcut right now! Press meta+/ (meta being Alt/Option) to open the Shortcut Cheat Sheet, a list of all
            the shorcuts available in humanOS.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab content5">
        <h2>Adding Apps</h2>

        <p>humanOS is all about you owning your system, not the other way around. Because of this, it is extremely simple
            to add a new app from any source, not just one single app store where there are a bunch of guidelines in place.</p>
        
        <p>Of course, this does come with the issue of security. Because of the way humanOS apps work, any configured app will
            have access to your entire system. Because of this, make sure you trust the authour of the code, and if you're a
            little more tech savvy than most people, look through the code since these apps are forced to be open source.</p>
        
        <h3>How to</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Find the URL to your app's code. It should end in ".js".</li>
            <li>Open the Settings app (try the meta+i shorcut, with meta being the Alt/Option key)</li>
            <li>Look for the setting "Configured Apps"</li>
            <li>Add the URL to the code in the list, with double quotes around the URL</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you aren't sure about that last step, take a look at this example list:</p>
        <p><code>["http://example.com/someapp.js", "https://example.org/humanOS/app.js", "https://example.net/apps/loremipsum/main.js"]</code></p>
        <p>(note: none of the above URLs are real apps. If you want a real example app, try <code>"/apps/docs/exampleapp.js"</code>!)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab content6">
        <h2>Notifications</h2>

        <p>humanOS contains a built-in notification system that allows apps to notify the user of something.</p>
        <p>These notification bubbles will appear in the bottom left of the desktop above windows, and once clicked on will
            do some action, the default being closing the notification.</p>
        <p>Notifications can only be triggered when the application is open, as they were originally intended to be
            used more like dialogues. However, with the advent of actual full-screen banners, and in the future, proper
            in-window dialogues, there will become a way to have push notifications.</p>
        <p>I have no idea why I put this in a seperate tab group.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab content7">
        <h2>Dialogues</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="tab content8">
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>humanOS is a easy and quick development experience, most usually just requiring a single JS file.</p>

        <h3>Basic App</h3>
        <p>Start with single .js file hosted anywhere on the web:</p>

        <pre class="code" data-lang="JavaScript">export const client = {
    'id': 'my-app',
    'title': 'My First App',
    'content': `&lt;p&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/p&gt;`
}</pre>

        <p>Please try to keep the ID unique to your website or username, as ID conflicts in humanOS can be horrible.</p>
        <p>humanOS tries to keep this very simple, using <code>[websitename]--[taskname]</code>,
            where <code>[websitename]</code> can be replaced with the domain name of your website, e.g. example.com,
            and <code>[taskname]</code> can be replaced with the filename minus '.js'.</p>
        <p>You are allowed to do whatever you want and you don't have to follow this naming scheme, but please try your best to keep it unique.</p>

        <p>Now, back on track, the title is what is shown to the human behind the system as the window title.</p>
        <p>The content value is inline HTML. Yes, it's horrible, I am working on making a way to use external files.
            If you want ths behaviour gone already, humanOS does recognize iframes and automatically removes all the
            unnecessary stuff on the iframe by default so that your app fits in like the native ones.
            It won't support the user-selected font or other things, but that's just how things are right now.</p>
        
        <p>To test the app, follow the information in the Adding Apps section above and use the URL to your own source.</p>

        <h3>More Complicated Example</h3>
        <p>This is a very basic app, but we need a bit more. Here's a bit of a bigger example:</p>
        
        <pre class="code" data-lang="JavaScript">export const client = {
    'id': 'bigger-app',
    'title': 'Some Cool App',
    'icon': 'document-outline',
    'size': {
        'preset': 'mini'
    },
    'content': `
    &lt;p&gt;You should have recieved a notification. Isn't that cool?&lt;/p&gt;
    `,
    'onload': function (_clientId, api, _args) {
        return function () {
            api.create.notification({
                'title': 'Wow cool',
                'description': 'You got this notification from the cool app!'
            })
        }
    }
}</pre>

        <p>It should be pretty self explanatory, but here is some detail on what each new thing does:</p>

        <h4><code>icon</code></h4>
        <p>Give your app an icon from the <a href="https://ionic.io/ionicons" target="_blank">ionicons</a> library.</p>
        <p>The default value is <code>document-outline</code>.</p>

        <h4><code>size</code></h4>
        <p>This option lets you change the default opening size of a window.</p>
        <p>You can specify properties <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> to set a custom size, but there are presets:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>mini</code>: 250x150</li>
            <li><code>small</code>: 502x298</li>
            <li><code>default</code>: 550x325 (default)</li>
            <li><code>medium</code>: 650x400</li>
            <li><code>large</code>: 772x425</li>
            <li><code>xlarge</code>: 1200x800</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><code>onload</code></h4>
        <p>humanOS gives developers access to run some JavaScript code as soon as the task is done being processed.</p>
        <p>This property will be a function which returns the function to be run on load.</p>
        <p>The property itself will take parameters <code>clientId</code>, <code>api</code>, and <code>args</code>, which respectively:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Contain the window ID given to the window for the text, useful for modifying the window itself</li>
            <li>Contain a bunch of functions to operate with the system, which include <code>api.create.notification</code> which is described just below this.</li>
            <li>Contains the list of arguments passed to the window on creation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><code>api.create.notification</code></h4>
        <p>Which allows a window to display a notification in the bottom-left hand corner (see the Notifications section.)</p>
        <p>It takes one object with 4 properties:</p>

        <h5><code>title</code></h5>
        <p>A required property which sets the heading for the notification.</p>

        <h5><code>description</code></h5>
        <p>Also required. The actual text of the notification.</p>

        <h5><code>playSound</code></h5>
        <p>Optional. Should the notification play a sound when the notification appears? If not, switch this to false.</p>
        <p>This was originally only created so that the first-time notification didn't create an error due to the fact that the
            user needs to be focused on the window for the sound to be played. humanOS should be error-less, so here we are.</p>
        
        <h5><code>action</code></h5>
        <p>Also optional. A function that should be run when the notification is clicked.</p>
        <p>This function doesn't have any of that function-returning-function thing, since creation doesn't pass any arguments.</p>

        <h3>Even More Advanced</h3>

        <p>Still want more? Because there is more. Here is a very advanced program, that lets a user search the web:</p>

        <pre class="code" data-lang="JavaScript">export const client = {
    'id': 'web-searcher',
    'title': 'Web Searcher',
    'icon': 'search-outline',
    'size': {
        'height': '92px',
        'width': '250px',
        'rigid': 'true'
    },
    'content': `
    &lt;input type="text" id="%human%-input" placeholder="Search for anything..." /&gt;
    `,
    'options': [
        {
            'name': 'Cancel',
            'message': 'closeSelf'
        },
        {
            'name': 'Search',
            'message': 'script',
            'messagescript': function (clientId, _api) {
                return function () {
                    const searchQuery = document.getElementById(`${clientId}-input`).value
                    if (searchQuery !== '' && searchQuery !== null && searchQuery !== undefined && /\S/.test(searchQuery)) {
                        window.open(`https://duckduckgo.com/?q=${searchQuery}`)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}</pre>

        <p>There is a whole lot of new stuff going on here, and I have to explain it all now *sigh*.</p>

        <h4><code>rigid</code></h4>
        <p>By default, users can resize any window, but only down to a the mini window size.</p>
        <p>Turning on <code>rigid</code> makes it so that the user cannot resize the window and the window dimensions specified
            by the developer are used.</p>
        <p>This is useful for text input programs, where resizing the program will break the layout, and a specified set of
            dimensions is usually wanted.</p>
        
        <h4><code>%human%</code> or <code>%human-id%</code></h4>
        <p>These two templates insert the given window ID into the source at that point.</p>
        <p>Due to the fact that the content is directly injected into the document, having inputs can be hard,
            because multiple windows could be using the same ID for a text input.</p>
        <p>This template simplifies that.</p>
        
        <h4><code>options</code></h4>
        <p>This is the biggest addition to your knowledge currently.</p>
        <p>Option buttons are shown at the bottom of a window, and once clicked on do something.</p>
        <p>The <code>name</code> attribute here is the text to the button, and <code>message</code> is what to do when the button is clicked.</p>
        <p>The <code>closeSelf</code> message just closes the window, useful for Cancel buttons.</p>
        <p>The <code>script</code> message allows a function to be run on the button click.</p>
        <p>These use the same syntax as the <code>onload</code> function-returns-function things we saw earlier.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab content9">
        <h2>Bugman</h2>
        <p>The Bugman program and more about hidden stuff in humanOS in general</p>

        <p>Bugman is a program used for testing purposes and other purposes.</p>
        <p>It gives quick access to system information, WIP features, WIP apps, hidden apps, testing apps, and WIP controls.</p>
        <p>It was originally created for testing new features, and it shows! There is a setting to automatically open Bugman on
            startup, due to the amount of refreshing required in testing web apps.</p>
        <p>It gives access to a lot of useful testing programs, such as the Notification Engine, which allows to create
            notifications with custom text without having to go through the effort of creating an entirely new application just
            for this purpose.</p>
