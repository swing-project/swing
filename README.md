# Swing

An web-technologies-based operating system embracing simplicity and readability.

## Layout

- .vscode: Visual Studio Code configuration files.
- apps: Built-in apps for Swing.
- css: Stylesheets. The name "css" is misleading, since it actually contains [Less](https://lesscss.org) stylesheets.
- etc: Et cetera. Contains some stuff that might not be relavent.
- js: Scripts.
- media: Contains files available inside the system, such as wallpapers, icons, and sounds.
- repositories: WIP. Don't touch.

## How it works, thoughts, ideas, etc

- Everything is front-end. There is no server-side stuff. Everything's static.
- Alt as shorcut key rather than Ctrl.
- Stylesheets are written in Less rather than CSS.
- Apps are one single JavaScript file.
- Pseudo-flat look.
